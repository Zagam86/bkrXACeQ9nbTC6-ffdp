3.4.4 “Wagoner stars”
Wagoner47 described a mechanism for gravitational radiation from a low magnetic
field neutron star, such as PSR1937+214, which is in the process of being spun up
by accretion from a companion star. As the neutron star acquires angular momentum
it reaches a point where it may become unstable to the emission of gravitational
radiation. This instability was originally discovered by Chandrasekhar,48 then studied
in detail by Friedman and Schutz.49 In a rapidly rotating object, gravitational
radiation reaction forces tend to drive a non-axisymmetric distortion which in turn
enhances the gravitational radiation. This instability is damped by viscosity in the
neutron star, so that a steady-state is attained. The resulting amplitude of ¨I thus
depends on the poorly-known value of the viscosity of nuclear matter under the
conditions of a neutron star.Wagoner gave an estimate assuming one probable value
for this viscosity, and noted that an m = 3 or 4 distortion (rather than the m = 2
quadrupole) is most likely to be excited. The gravitational radiation would then be
emitted at f = 500 ± 300 Hz, with an amplitude given
