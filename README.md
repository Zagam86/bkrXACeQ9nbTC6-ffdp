The discovery of gravitational waves by the two LIGO interferometers on 14
September 2015 sent me back to this introductory book on how to understand
interferometric detectors of gravitational waves. It seemed likely that there might
be a new generation of students interested in the book.
A complete revision was not possible. Instead, I’ve written an epilogue
(Chapter 17), intended to show how to use the original book as an introduction
to the subject, and then how a reader can move on to a higher level of competence by
study of the more recent (and more advanced) literature. I urge the reader to consult
Chapter 17 early and often. That chapter’s introduction (Section 17.1) should
be read right away for further guidance on how this edition should be used today;
then, as the reader progresses in her study of the book, I’d urge her to return to
the relevant sections of the epilogue for commentary, context, and suggestions for
further study.
I’ve spent the entire period since writing the first edition as a member of the
Department of Physics in the College of Arts and Sciences at Syracuse University.
It has remained the most congenial and supportive home that one could ask
for. Members of the SU Gravitational Wave Group have made it a pleasure to
come to work every day. I am profoundly grateful to my former graduate students
Gabriela González, Yinglei Huang, Will Startin, Andri Gretarsson, Scott
Kittelberger, Eiichi Hirose, Matt West, and T. J. Massinger. Among the postdocs
with whom I’ve worked, I’d like to thank especially Mark Beilby, Gregg Harry, Steve
Penn, Alessandra Di Credico, Josh Smith, Antonio Perreca, and Laura Nuttall, as
well as my colleague Ryan Fisher. My fellow faculty members, Duncan Brown and
Stefan Ballmer, have brought life, leadership, and vision to the group. All of the
members of our group have been a tremendous source of understanding and insight
of all kinds.
